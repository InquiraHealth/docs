A workflow is like a map that guides your AI agent through conversations. Think of it as a flowchart where each step represents what the agent should say or do next.

## The Editor Layout

The editor has three main parts:

- **Left Side**: Your workflow canvas where you build the conversation flow
- **Right Side**: Properties panel where you customize the selected elements
- **Top Bar**: Toolbar with buttons to manage your workflow

A workflow is made up of several states. Each state has nodes that are connected by edges.

## Workflow Nodes

You can add a new node to the workflow by pressing the `+` button in the canvas.

![Add Node](/images/workflows/add-node.png)

Workflows currently supports the following nodes:

- **Default State Node**: The first node of a new conversation [state](/concepts/workflows#workflow-states)
- **Default Node**: Says a fixed or AI-driven message.

Fixed messages are said as is without any changes while AI-driven messages are processed by the AI agent to come-up with answers themselves.

- **Function Node**: Performs specific functions like verifying Date of Birth or matching names
- **Transition Node**: Switches the state of the conversation
- **Control Node**: Controls conversation flow with actions like Hangup or Transfer

## Workflow States

A state is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges. States are used to organize longer conversations.

Consider each state as a seperate objective of the conversation.

For each state you can define a state prioritiy of **None**, **Secondary** or **Primary**.

<Note>
    If a state has a **Primary** priority and that state is never reached in a call then we consider the call to be failed.

## Making Your Workflow Dynamic

You can use variables to make your workflow dynamic. See the [Inputs](/concepts/workflows/inputs) and [Outputs](/concepts/workflows/outputs) pages for more information.

### Testing Your Flow

Use the chat preview in the right panel to:
- Test how your workflow runs
- See how variables perform
- Check different conversation paths

## Organizing Your Workflow

### States

States help organize longer conversations:
- Group related steps together
- Create clear sections (like "Greeting", "Appointment Booking", "Farewell")
- Keep your workflow neat and manageable

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple**
   - Break complex conversations into smaller states
   - Use clear, conversational language
   - Test each path thoroughly

2. **Save Your Work**
   - Create new versions for major changes
   - Test before publishing
   - Keep notes about what changed

## Publishing Your Workflow

When you're ready to make your workflow live:

1. Click "Publish" in the top bar
2. Review your changes
3. Confirm [deployment](/concepts/deployments)

## Customizing Your Agent

### Voice Settings
Click the "Voice" button to:

- Choose your agent's voice and language

Inquira supports 57+ languages and has support for 100+ voices.

See a full list of [supported languages](/reference/languages)

## Need Help?

- Look for the (?) help icons throughout the editor
- Use the chat preview to test your changes
- Contact support if you get stuck

## Quick Tips

1. **Preview Often**: Test your workflow frequently
2. **Start Small**: Begin with simple flows and expand
3. **Use States**: Organize complex conversations into states
4. **Version Control**: Create new versions for major changes
5. **Test Variables**: Verify all personalized content works

Remember: The best workflows feel natural and conversational while efficiently achieving their goals.
