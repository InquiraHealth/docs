# Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of your conversation workflow. Each node type serves a specific purpose and helps you create dynamic and interactive conversations. Here's a detailed overview of each node type available in the workflow builder.

## Default State Node

The Default State Node is the entry point of any new conversation state. It marks the beginning of a conversation flow and initializes the conversation context.

- **Purpose**: Serves as the starting point for a new conversation state
- **Icon**: Message icon
- **Use Case**: Always used as the first node when creating a new conversation state

## Default Node

The Default Node is your basic conversation building block that can deliver messages to the user.

- **Purpose**: Sends messages to the user
- **Icon**: Message icon
- **Features**:
  - Can send fixed (pre-written) messages
  - Supports AI-driven dynamic responses
  - Ideal for basic conversation interactions

## Function Node

The Function Node adds logic and data processing capabilities to your conversation flow.

- **Purpose**: Executes specific functions or operations
- **Icon**: Function icon
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - Verify Date of Birth
  - Match names or other data
  - Perform data validation
  - Execute custom business logic

## Transition Node

The Transition Node allows you to switch between different conversation states, enabling complex conversation flows.

- **Purpose**: Changes the current state of the conversation
- **Icon**: Arrow right icon
- **Use Cases**:
  - Move to a different conversation topic
  - Switch to error handling states
  - Transition to follow-up conversations
  - Change conversation context

## Control Node

The Control Node manages the flow and behavior of the conversation at a system level.

- **Purpose**: Controls conversation flow and system actions
- **Icon**: Hierarchy icon
- **Features**:
  - Conversation termination (Hangup)
  - Call transfers
  - System-level controls
  - Flow control operations

## Best Practices

When using nodes in your workflow:

1. Always start with a Default State Node when creating a new conversation state
2. Use Default Nodes for simple message exchanges
3. Implement Function Nodes for data validation and processing
4. Use Transition Nodes to create complex, multi-state conversations
5. Apply Control Nodes for system-level operations and flow management
