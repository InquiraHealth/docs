With Inquira you can bring your own phone numbers or buy one of our pre-provisioned numbers to use with your deployments.

## Managing Phone Numbers

Request a phone number from the Inquira UI by clicking the "Request a Number" button.

We use [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com/) to provision and manage phone numbers.

### Data Requirements When Requesting a Number

To ensure the phone number is provisioned correctly, Telnyx will require the following information from your organization:

- Contact Info

Your full name, phone number and organisation name.

- Organisation Address

Your organisation address.

- Passport or ID Copy

A copy of your passport or ID.

- Company Registration Certificate

A copy of your company registration certificate.

- Proof of Address

A copy of a recent utility bill or bank statement to prove your address.

### Bring your own numbers

We provide SIP Trunking for outbound and inbound calls.

Internally we support the G.711U and G.722 codecs.

SIP Authentication is done via credentials and for incoming calls we would need to know the IP address of your server to ensure the call is not blocked by firewalls.

Contact support to get started.
