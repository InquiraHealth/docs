# Understanding Deployments

## What is a Deployment?

A Deployment is how you make your workflow available to interact with users. It represents an active instance of your workflow that can handle either incoming or outgoing calls. When you create a deployment, you're essentially making your workflow "live" and ready to interact with users.

## Types of Deployments

There are currently two types of deployments available:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Outgoing Call Deployment">
    - Makes outbound calls to your customers
    - Requires a list of users to call
    - Follows a schedule you define
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incoming Call Deployment">
    - Handles incoming calls from your customers
    - Can include predefined user data for personalization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
