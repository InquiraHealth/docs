A Deployment is how you make your workflow available to interact with users. It represents an active instance of your workflow that can handle either incoming or outgoing calls. When you create a deployment, you're essentially making your workflow "live" and ready to interact with users.

## Types of Deployments

There are currently two types of deployments available:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Outgoing Call Deployment">
    - Makes outbound calls to your customers
    - Requires a list of users to call
    - Follows a schedule you define
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incoming Call Deployment">
    - Handles incoming calls from your customers
    - Can include predefined user data for personalization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

  Chat deployments are coming soon! If this is something you need early access to, please contact us.

### Input Data

First read the [Workflow Inputs](/concepts/workflows/inputs) page to understand how to define the input data for your workflow.

Once you have an input schema, you can use it in your deployment by uploading a CSV file or using the [API](api-reference/deployments/add-users-to-deployment).

To try an example, create a new Template deployment with the Appointment Reminder workflow and use the [sample input data](https://github.com/InquiraHealth/docs/tree/main/files/sample-appointment-inputs.csv).

When you pass this data to an outbound deployment, the system will automatically schedule outgoing calls to your users based on the phone numbers you provide.

If it is an inbound deployment, the system will map the user data depending on the incoming phone number.

<Info>
  Note: We map the inbound phone number to the user based on the caller ID that the users phone number advertises.

### Outbound Deployment Settings
