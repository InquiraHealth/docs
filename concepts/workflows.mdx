A workflow is like a map that guides your AI agent through conversations. Think of it as a flowchart where each step represents what the agent should say or do next.

## The Editor Layout

The editor has three main parts:

- **Left Side**: Your workflow canvas where you build the conversation flow
- **Right Side**: Properties panel where you customize the selected elements
- **Top Bar**: Toolbar with buttons to manage your workflow

A workflow is made up of several states. Each state has nodes that are connected by edges.

## Workflow Nodes

You can add a new node to the workflow by pressing the `+` button in the canvas.

![Add Node](/images/workflows/add-node.png)

Workflows currently supports the following nodes:

- **Default State Node**: The first node of a new conversation [state](/concepts/workflows#workflow-states)
- **Default Node**: Says a fixed or AI-driven message.

Fixed messages are said as is without any changes while AI-driven messages are processed by the AI agent to come-up with answers themselves.

- **Function Node**: Performs specific functions like verifying Date of Birth or matching names
- **Transition Node**: Switches the state of the conversation
- **Control Node**: Controls conversation flow with actions like Hangup or Transfer

## Workflow States

A state is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges. States are used to organize longer conversations.

Consider each state as a seperate objective of the conversation.

For each state you can define a state prioritiy of **None**, **Secondary** or **Primary**.

<Note>
    If a state has a **Primary** priority and that state is never reached in a call then we consider the call to be failed.

## Making Your Workflow Dynamic

### Using Variables

Variables make your conversations personalized. For example:
- `Hello $Input.first_name!` becomes "Hello Jane!"
- `Your appointment is on $Input.appointment_date` becomes "Your appointment is on 12 March 2025"

To set up variables:
1. Click the "Variables" button in the top bar
2. Go to the Schema Editor tab and add your variables and their types
3. Specify a value for the variable in the Input Variables tab to test your workflow
4. Now you can use `$Input.variable_name` in the Fixed or AI-driven messages of your nodes.

<Info>
    If your variable is detected, `$Input.variable_name` will be replaced with the value of the variable.
</Info>

### Variable Functions

Some variable types support special functions to make the value more usable in a conversation.

This allows an appointment_date_time value of "12 March 2025 10:00" to be converted to "Wednesday" or "12 March" or "10 AM".

Currently the functions are only available for functions with format "date" or "date-time" and the following fucntions are supported:

- `formatDayOfWeek`
Returns the day of the week in the format "Wednesday"

- `formatShortDate`
Returns the short date in the format "12 March"

- `formatLongDate`
Returns the full date in the format "12 March 2025"

- `formatLocalizedTime`
Returns localized time in the format "10 AM" (localised in the language of the workflow)

To use these you can use the following syntax:

`$Input.appointment_date_time.formatDayOfWeek`

### Testing Your Flow

Use the chat preview in the right panel to:
- Test how your workflow runs
- See how variables perform
- Check different conversation paths

## Organizing Your Workflow

### States

States help organize longer conversations:
- Group related steps together
- Create clear sections (like "Greeting", "Appointment Booking", "Farewell")
- Keep your workflow neat and manageable

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple**
   - Break complex conversations into smaller states
   - Use clear, conversational language
   - Test each path thoroughly

2. **Save Your Work**
   - Create new versions for major changes
   - Test before publishing
   - Keep notes about what changed

## Publishing Your Workflow

When you're ready to make your workflow live:

1. Click "Publish" in the top bar
2. Review your changes
3. Confirm [deployment](/concepts/deployments)

## Customizing Your Agent

### Voice Settings
Click the "Voice" button to:

- Choose your agent's voice and language

Inquira supports 57+ languages and has support for 100+ voices.

See a full list of [supported languages](/reference/languages)

## Need Help?

- Look for the (?) help icons throughout the editor
- Use the chat preview to test your changes
- Contact support if you get stuck

## Quick Tips

1. **Preview Often**: Test your workflow frequently
2. **Start Small**: Begin with simple flows and expand
3. **Use States**: Organize complex conversations into states
4. **Version Control**: Create new versions for major changes
5. **Test Variables**: Verify all personalized content works

Remember: The best workflows feel natural and conversational while efficiently achieving their goals.
